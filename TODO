FEATURES
- Apply should only apply if check does not report presence
  (?) What indicates presence here?  "applied/incomplete/missing" strings in STDOUT of unit?
- Better reporting UI
  - --report=full includes STDOUT/STDIN from subprocesses in output
  - --report=min (default) does not include STDOUT/STDIN
