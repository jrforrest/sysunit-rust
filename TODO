FEATURES
- Apply should only apply if check does not report presence
  (?) What indicates presence here?  "applied/incomplete/missing" strings in STDOUT of unit?
    - How about just "ok" for starters if its present, any other output means nothing is there

- Test execution for directory units
  - Allow directory units to provide a `./test` executable which can
    assert that the unit has altered system state as expected

- Adapters for specifying remote targets
  - Runing with something like --target=ssh://root@git.jackforrest.codes should
    allow managing remote systems with units located on the origin machine.

- Manifest Units
  - Units that only have dependencies can be expressed in a .toml file

- Unit Docs
  - unit.toml in 
  - Something like a `meta` operation should recieve .toml output
    from units that will be used to produce structured documentation
    for that unit

- .toml for dependencies
  - This should be a decent minmal language that'll be much easier
    to output from simple shell scripts and such than JSON, but will
    allow more elaborate parameters with structured and typed data

- .toml arguments
  - We can probably provide a full .toml via some file descriptor that
    units can choose to open and read if they wish to receive typed data
